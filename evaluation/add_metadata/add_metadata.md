## Importance of Adding a Tag

### Adding a Tag (`add_tag`)
- **Function**: `add_tag`
- **Description**: This transformer function adds a static tag (`'v0.0.1'`) to each record in the dataset.
- **Usage**: The function is decorated with `@dlt.transformer` to define it as a transformer that processes each record yielded by the data resource.

### Benefits
1. **Version Control**: By adding a version tag to each record, you can easily track which version of the data processing pipeline was used to generate or modify the data. This is particularly useful for debugging and auditing purposes.
2. **Data Lineage**: Tags help in maintaining data lineage by providing metadata that indicates the origin or the processing stage of the data. This can be crucial for compliance and data governance.
3. **Consistency**: Ensuring that each record has a consistent tag can help in identifying and segregating data processed at different times or by different versions of the pipeline.
4. **Filtering and Analysis**: Tags can be used to filter and analyze data subsets. For example, you can query the database to retrieve only those records that have a specific tag, facilitating targeted analysis.

### General Application
The concept of adding a tag can be extended to other metadata attributes such as timestamps, user IDs, or processing flags. This enhances the traceability and manageability of data across various stages of the pipeline.

By incorporating such metadata, you can create more robust and maintainable data processing workflows that are easier to monitor, audit, and debug.
